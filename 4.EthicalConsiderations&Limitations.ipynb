    "#### 1.1. Fairness & Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "A model may unfairly treat certain customer groups if:\n",
    "- the data contains historical biases (e.g., income, age, contract type)\n",
    "- uneven representation of categories impacts learning\n",
    "- one socioeconomic group churns disproportionately, and the model begins to \"penalize\" it automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "__Risks__:\n",
    "- Discrimination of customers by age, income, and education\n",
    "- Deterioration of service conditions due to false predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "__What can be done__:\n",
    "- evaluate fairness metrics (Disparate Impact, Equalized Odds)\n",
    "- remove/hide socially sensitive features\n",
    "- apply fairness regularization"

    "- data retention policy\n",

    "- there is no information that could identify a specific person\n",
    "- data is not transferred to open services\n",
    "- secure storage is used\n",

    "\n",

    "- cannot be the sole factor in account closure\n",
    "- must be used as a tool, not an automatic action classifier\n",

    "- use the model only to improve service\n",

    "According to the correlation matrix:\n",
    "- no numeric field correlates strongly with Churn\n",
    "- most behavioral factors are weakly related to churn\n",

    "Although the dataset appears clean:\n",
    "- hidden outliers are possible\n",
    "- temporal component is missing\n",
    "- categorical features are simplified and truncated\n",

    "#### 2.5. No Real Causality\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate correlations, but not causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model cannot say:\n",

    "```\"a customer will leave because they reduced card usage.\"```\n",

    "The model was trained on data from one company →\n",
    "may perform poorly:\n",
    "- in other countries\n",
    "- on other tariffs\n",
    "- with other types of clients\n",
